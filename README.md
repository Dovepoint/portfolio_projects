Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains the code for my Weather App project, which is a simple web application that allows users to check the current temperature of a city.


The Weather App is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input.


Users can enter the name of a city.
Upon submission, the application fetches the current temperature of the specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API.
The temperature is displayed on the screen.
If the city is not recognised or there is an error fetching data, an appropriate message is displayed.
